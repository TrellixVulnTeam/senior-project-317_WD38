# Firebase Functions
This folder is used to store files required to create functions in Firebase.
This includes functions to automatically edit the database.

The primary place to edit the functions is in ./functions/index.js
See the Firebase documentation for help on how that works.

To learn how to connect to Firebase and deploy any edits, you'll have to play with the command line.
See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started for instructions
