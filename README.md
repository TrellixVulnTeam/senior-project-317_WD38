# senior-project-317: Campus Bluetooth Tag Network
VCU CS Senior Project 317, Fall 2017 - Spring 2018. 
Repository for code and for documentation.

Faculty adviser/mentor: Dr. Bulut
Team members: Nicholas Bennnett, Jordan Mays-Rowland, Justin Yirka

## Project goal 
Design an open-source alternative to commercial item-tracking products such as Tile and TrackR, which use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags to track and locate lost items. The system should include an Android and iOS app for users.

## Brief description of product
We developed an Android and iOS app which interacted with a Google Firebase database, succesfully replicating many of the features of existing products like Tile.
A significant novel feature was the design of 'fixed scanners' using Raspberry Pis.
